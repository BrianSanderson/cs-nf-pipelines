Each of folder will contain all of the Nextflow DSL2 Scripts and Bash Scripts for running the appropriate pipeline on Sumner HPC. Nextflow will handle any pulling of linux containers from Quay.io automatically. Modifications may be required if you plan on running these pipelines on the cloud or your personal computer.
